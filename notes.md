- DPMC gives back limited precision, which puts a hard limit of the error
- Cachet and TensorOrder need a normalization step, which becomes a problem for large vertex counts (~200). Even though runtimes are still low, the solvers cannot be used.
- Complexity is polynomial in the number of layers for fixed problem.
